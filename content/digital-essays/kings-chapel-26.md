# King's Chapel's Connections to the Atlantic World

### Religion in the Massachusetts Bay Colony

When the Massachusetts Bay Colony was founded in 1630, the colony’s government was founded on Congregational Puritan beliefs. Among many religiously based laws, the original charter of [the colony limited voting rights to only white male members of the local Congregationalist churches](https://www.thearda.com/us-religion/history/timelines/entry?etype=1&eid=55). The majority of the white people living in the colony at the time fell into this category, so these laws served mainly to reinforce prejudices against other Christians, like Quakers, Baptists, and Anglicans (a.k.a. members of the Church of England). After the Restoration of the Monarchy after the English Civil War and Interregnum, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was incorporated into the [Dominion of New England](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/dominion-new-england) by King James II and thus came under much tighter control by the Crown than it had been previously.

King James mandated the introduction of the Church of England into Massachusetts against the wishes of many of the colonists, but there were enough Anglicans in Boston to establish a small congregation. As a result, King’s Chapel was first organized in 1686 with Rev. Robert Ratcliffe as its rector. Although the Dominion of New England only lasted three years, this time period enabled Anglicanism to establish a foothold in New England. [King’s Chapel’s congregation grew fairly quickly](https://www.kings-chapel.org/briefhistorykc.html), so by the mid-1700s, daughter churches could be established, including Old North Church and Trinity Church.

### The Building of King’s Chapel

The building called King’s Chapel was originally constructed in 1688 out of wood at the current site of the church. It was the first Church of England (Anglican) church in New England. Since most of the inhabitants of Massachusetts still followed Puritanism and the systems established in the colony favored it over all other religions despite royal rule at the time, [no resident would sell land to a non-Congregationalist church](https://www.jstor.org/stable/42968145) and Boston was already too crowded to simply find an open space to build. This site was chosen because the preexisting burying ground, which predates the church despite its modern name, was public land.

The congregation had expanded enough to require a larger space by 1749, so it was decided that a stone building should replace the original wooden structure. Construction on the new building began literally around the old one. When the stone church was completed in 1754, the wooden structure inside was disassembled and the wood was shipped to Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. There it was incorporated into St. John’s Anglican Church, the second Church of England church in Nova Scotia. Unfortunately, St. John’s was badly damaged in a fire in 2001, so it is unclear how much of the original wood from King’s Chapel remains. Both church buildings are still in use with active congregations, the stone in Boston and the wooden in Lunenburg. Only St. John’s remains Anglican today.

### The Early Ministers of King’s Chapel

[Rev. Ratcliffe](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/glossary/ratcliffe-robert/) was born in England and was a graduate of Oxford. He was assigned to Boston by the Bishop of London. Although Rev. Ratcliffe was the first rector of King’s Chapel, he served for only three years, and his last official act seems to have been presiding over the opening of the chapel building in 1689. This was the same year the Dominion of New England was dissolved, and the Massachusetts Bay Colony reverted to its former charter. As a result, the royal government was overthrown and Ratcliffe was forced to return to England. [King’s Chapel had four more rectors before 1776 and nine assistant ministers between its founding and the American Revolution](https://www.kings-chapel.org/334-years-of-ministry.html).

Because there were comparatively few Anglicans in North America, especially in New England, many ministers of the faith in the 1700s were placed by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. The Society was established in 1701 by Royal Charter issued by King William III, and many of the Anglican (now largely called Episcopal) churches established in what would become the United States during the 1700s were founded by Society members. Not all were born in Britain, but many certainly were. In 1776, with the War for Independence underway, most Anglican ministers in Massachusetts fled the war, as they were generally seen as loyalists. As the King of England was also the spiritual head of the church, prayers for the king and his officers were part of regular service in the Church of England. Ministers for the Church of England in the colonies [“declined to omit the prescribed form of prayers for the king and royal authorities,”](https://salempl.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Salem-Before-the-Revolution-Streeter-1896.pdf) so whatever their personal convictions toward independence, their spiritual beliefs were still tied to the king. Only two Anglican ministers in the colony are known to have stayed, Dr. Samuel Parker at Trinity Church [(where the remaining congregation of King’s Chapel went to worship during the war)](https://www.kings-chapel.org/briefhistorykc.html) and the aging [Rev. William McGilchrist of St. Peter’s Church in Salem, who died in 1780](https://salempl.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Salem-Before-the-Revolution-Streeter-1896.pdf). After the war, the Church of England in the new United States was reorganized as the Episcopal Church and Dr. Parker was elected the second Bishop of Massachusetts in 1803. Under its first rector after the Revolution, James Freeman, [King’s Chapel became Unitarian](https://www.kings-chapel.org/briefhistorykc.html) instead of being fully incorporated into the new Episcopalian tradition.
